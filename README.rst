Babu
====

Babu is a static site generator for Python, designed to let you build your static sites the way you build dynamic sites in Django and Flask, rather than (mis-)using YAML for everything.

It is named after Akshinthala Seshu Babu, `current holder of the world record for motionlessness <http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/motion.html>`_.
